## 👋 About

I’m **Suraj Wandhare**, an Information Security Engineer. This site is my working notebook: practical pentest notes, reproducible walkthroughs, and automation snippets that make security work faster, safer, and more consistent.

Content here is written to be **repeatable** and **ethical**. If something helps you, great—adapt it, attribute it, and use it responsibly.

## 🗂 What you’ll find

- **Pentest tips & tricks** — enumeration checklists, living notes, and edge cases I keep hitting.
- **Write‑ups**
  - **Hack The Box (HTB)**: clean, step‑by‑step methodology with lessons learned.
  - **VulnLab**: approaches, pitfalls, and alternative paths.
- **Cheat sheets**
  - **Bash**: loops, parsing, traps, safety patterns, one‑liners.
  - **Python**: quick utilities, parsing, APIs, and reporting.
- **Homelab / Networking**
  - Switching, cabling, VLANs, LAGs, QoS, and how to squeeze your ISP bandwidth to its **legal** fullest.
